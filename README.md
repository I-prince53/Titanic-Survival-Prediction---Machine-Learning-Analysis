# Titanic-Survival-Prediction---Machine-Learning-Analysis
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to solve the mystery of "Who survived and why?" Using Python and Data Science techniques, I investigated the factors that influenced survival rates and built a Machine Learning model to predict passenger survival.

# Key Findings (Data Analysis):

Women First: Female passengers had a 74% survival chance, compared to only 18% for males.

Wealth Matters: First-class (rich) passengers had a significantly higher survival rate (63%) than Third-class passengers (24%).

Age Factor: Children were prioritized during the rescue, validating the "Women and Children First" policy.

# Machine Learning Model:

Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier (Scikit-Learn).

Process: Handled missing values (Age), performed Feature Encoding (Sex), and implemented Train-Test Split validation.

Performance: Achieved a Test Accuracy of ~76%, ensuring the model is not overfitted and works on unseen data.

# Tech Stack:

Python: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn
